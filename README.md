# Turtle Crossing Game

A fun and interactive Turtle Crossing game built using Python's `turtle` module. The goal is to guide the turtle to the top of the screen while avoiding moving cars. The challenge increases as you level up!

## Features

- **Player Control**: Move the turtle upwards using the keyboard arrow keys.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Cars of different colors move across the screen at random speeds, and their speed increases with each level.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your progress with a level-based system. Each successful crossing advances the player to a higher level.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the turtle collides with a car, and a "Game Over" message is displayed.

## How to Play

1. Use the up arrow key to move the turtle forward.
2. Dodge the oncoming cars to avoid collisions.
3. Reach the top of the screen to progress to the next level.
4. Keep playing until your turtle gets hit!
